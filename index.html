          A crucial period of technological growth occurred between the years
          1850 and 1920. This era saw the perfection of the

          which finally made large-scale steel production inexpensive and
          efficient. Before this advancement, iron was the primary building
          material, but steel’s greater strength-to-weight ratio allowed for the
          construction of taller structures and more powerful machines. The
          Bessemer process involved blowing air through molten pig iron to
          remove impurities, and it revolutionized manufacturing on a global
          scale.

          This industrial momentum also led to major innovations in
          transportation.

          The expansion of railways linked cities and nations, enabling trade,
          migration, and cultural exchange on an unprecedented scale. The use of
          coal as a primary fuel source powered these engines, driving factories
          and vehicles alike—but it also created a heavy environmental toll,
          filling industrial cities with smoke and soot.

          It is important to remember that all this progress was built on the

          and their families. Workers often toiled twelve-hour shifts in
          dangerous factories with poor ventilation and minimal pay. Industrial
          accidents were common, and child labor became a widespread issue of
          the era.

          This immense industrial output transformed global economies, creating
          the foundation of the modern industrial world. However, the rapid pace
          of change often masked deep social inequalities. The relentless
          pursuit of efficiency prioritized machinery and output over human
          welfare, leading to long working hours, dangerous conditions, and
          widening gaps between classes. Meanwhile, the shift from rural
          communities to crowded urban centers placed enormous strain on public
          services such as housing, sanitation, and healthcare.

          The final technological leap of the period was the widespread adoption
          of electricity, moving industry beyond steam power.

          The introduction of electric lighting, motors, and streetcars
          redefined modern life, bringing greater safety, productivity, and
          accessibility to city streets and homes. While the internal combustion
          engine was still in its infancy, electricity paved the way for the
          next century of innovation, powering the industries, transportation
          systems, and technologies that would shape the modern world.
